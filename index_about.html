                    <h2> About Eastenburg </h2>
                    <p>
                        Eastenburg was <i>born and raised</i> in a metropolitan of equi-latitude with Windy City and nuke-reachable by Russia and NK. During <i>the pre-school years</i>, his unsuccessful practices included Go, drawing, keyboard and Jazz Drum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In <i>elementary school</i>, he was obsessed with astronomy, geographical science and ancient Chinese, didn't show outstanding talent in Olympiad math, and played soccer and badminton. When attending <i>middle school</i>, he cultivated his interest in literature and basketball, and in the last year buried himself in HS entrance exam preparation. His passion in finance and politics set its vintage in <i>the first year of HS</i>, around when he also inititated his halfhearted preparation of TOEFL and SAT.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Spending <i>the first four years of adulthood</i> in Southern California, he constructed his internal building of mathematics, became captivated by programming, and was well shocked by the diversity of people's attitude toward education. Moving from the west coast metropolitan to <i>a tristate township</i>, he perhaps enjoyed the divergence of the historical peacefulness and the quant hangover. By <i>the Great Lakes</i>, while lost in suboptimal trials of engineering and life, he obtained some best Pharah Ult highlights and life-long friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Accompanied by his wish of a CS master and a JD, he now advances down his path settling down in <i>APAC</i> and playing <i>the duet</i> of business remuneration and social value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through <i>all these years</i>, he is an avid reader and never stops learning. 吾生也有涯，而知也无涯。以有涯而随无涯，吾所愿矣。
                    </p>
